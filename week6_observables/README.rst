QMC Observables
========================================================

In this directory you will find the Week 6 Observables presentation ``week6_observables.pdf``
and a QMCPACK lab (inside the directory ``01_density_water``) that walks you through the 
calculaiton of the extrapolated estimate of the charge density for the H2O molecule.

For more information about Nexus and QMCPACK, please consult their respective documentation:

* QMCPACK: https://qmcpack.readthedocs.io/en/develop/
* Nexus: https://nexus-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For more information on QMC methods in general (theory and application), 
the 2001 Rev. Mod. Phys. by Foulkes et al. is essential reading:
