QMC Observables
========================================================

In this directory you will find the Week 6 Observables presentation ``Observables.pdf``
and a QMCPACK lab that walks you through the calculaiton of the extrapolated estimate 
of the charge density for the H2O molecule.

For more information about Nexus and QMCPACK, please consult their respective documentation:

* Nexus: https://nexus-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For more information on QMC methods in general (theory and application), 
the 2001 Rev. Mod. Phys. by Foulkes et al. is essential reading:

This lab uses the ``qmca`` and ``qmc-fit`` tools for statistical data analysis.  See their respective documentation for more details:
