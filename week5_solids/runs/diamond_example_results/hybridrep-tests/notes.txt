Hybridrep tests:

1.) Run the baseline case with a large meshfactor to ensure converged energy
2.) Scan effect of lmax, meshfactor, spline cutoff on energy by copying and editing "tw0-hybrid-lmax2-mf0.5".

The hybridrep calculations with lmax = 6 are statistically identical
to the calculation on a rectilinear mesh with larger meshfactor. But
the hybridrep wavefunction requires ~20% less memory.
