#
# Step 0.a) Specify the system to simulate
#           This test problem shows a sample workflow for
#           solids in which the DFT and wave function
#           generation is done in a primitive cell using
#           k-points to tile a supercell for subsequent
#           QMC calculations.
#
#           Here, we construct a primitive cell of carbon
#           diamond at ambient density.
#
a = 3.57
primcell  = generate_physical_system(
    units = 'A',                  # Angstrom units
    axes  = [[a/2, a/2,   0],     # Cell axes
             [  0, a/2, a/2],
             [a/2,   0, a/2]],
    elem  = ['C','C'],            # Element names
    posu  = [[0.00, 0.00, 0.00],  # Element positions (crystal units)
             [0.25, 0.25, 0.25]],
    C     = 4,                    # Pseudpotential valence charge
)


# 
# Step 0.b) Here we use Nexus to generate the optimal (most spherical)
#           supercell composed of 8 atoms (4x copies of prim. cell).
#
#           If you wanted to scan the number of twists required to
#           converge the total energy in this supercell, adjust kgrid.
# 
# NB: The number of twists in the supercell determines the number of kpoint
#     needed in the primcell, so a larger supercell, or a denser twistgrid
#     are both more expensive (but still very cheap compared to QMC!)
#
tiled = primcell.structure.tile_opt(4)
tiled.add_symmetrized_kmesh(kgrid=(2,2,2),kshift=(0,0,0))
supercell = generate_physical_system(structure = tiled, C=4)

#
# Step 1.) DFT calculation with Quantum ESPRESSO
#          Note that the system we specify is the primcell
#          and a very large kpoint grid. This is done in order
#          to provide a well-converged density from which we will
#          subsequently generate SPOs to be used in the QMC calculation.

)


#
# Step 2.) DFT wave function generation with Quantum ESPRESSO
#          Notice that here we do a nscf calculation using the
#          converged density from the previous scf calculation.
#          And also the kpoints we need are given by the supercell.
#
#          If you look inside the supercell object, you'll see that it
#          knows the map from prim->super cell, and so Nexus will
#          automatically do a primcell calculation with the correct kpoints
#          to tile into the corresponding supercell.
